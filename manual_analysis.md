# TOPCAT analysis of NGC 1605

This is a supplementary document for our Research Note on NGC 1605.

This document is structures as follows:
1. Classical manual cluster analysis with TOPCAT (for other examples see [this tutorial](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia-users/archive/use-cases))
2. Analysing NGC 1605 assuming that it is a double cluster (as suggested by Camargo 2021)

## 1. Classical manual analysis

We follow the typical steps: 
1. select a reasonable circular region around the cluster (say, 10 arcmin):

2. select the peak in proper-motion space
3. weed out stars with incompatible parallaxes
4. look at the colour-magnitude diagram to check if it is compatible with a cluster

## 2. Assuming NGC 1605 is in fact a double cluster

We follow the same steps, but now for NGC 1605a/b separately:
