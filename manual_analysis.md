# TOPCAT analysis of NGC 1605

This is a supplementary document for our Research Note on NGC 1605.

This document is structures as follows:
1. Classical manual cluster analysis with [TOPCAT](https://www.star.bris.ac.uk/~mbt/topcat/) (for example see [this tutorial](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia-users/archive/use-cases#ClusterAnalysisGUI))
2. Analysing NGC 1605 assuming that it is a double cluster (as suggested by Camargo 2021)

## 1. Classical manual analysis

We follow the typical steps of a manual analysis using [TOPCAT](https://www.star.bris.ac.uk/~mbt/topcat/): 
1. select a reasonable circular region around the cluster (say, 10 arcmin):

2. select the peak in proper-motion space

3. weed out stars with incompatible parallaxes

4. look at the colour-magnitude diagram

## 2. Assuming NGC 1605 is in fact a double cluster

We follow the same steps, but now for NGC 1605a/b separately:
