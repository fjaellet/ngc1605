\section{Abstract}
The open star cluster NGC 1605 has recently been reported to in fact consist of two clusters (one intermediate-aged and one old) that merged via a flyby capture. Here we show that {\it Gaia} data does not support this scenario. We do, however, find another open-cluster candidate nearby.

\section{Introduction}
Gravitational captures of star clusters by other clusters are very rare and elusive events that can serve as laboratories for the destruction of star clusters (e.g. \citealt{Soubiran2018, Casado2022}). Recently, \citet{Piatti2022} presented a promising candidate for an open cluster collision of the nearby ($d\sim330$ pc) objects IC 4665 and Collinder 350.

Some months earlier, \citet{Camargo2021} reported the existence of a possible binary cluster, dubbed NGC 1605a/b, and suggested that it origined from a flyby capture. The author argued that the long-known cluster NGC 1605 actually consists of two components that have vastly different ages (2 Gyr and 600 Myr). Here we report that all commonly used clustering analysis techniques show no hint for multiple populations in this clusters.

Although relatively distant, close to the Galactic plane, and little studied, NGC 1605 has been included in the Galactic open cluster census since the 1970s. In the first deep photometric analysis, \citet{Fang1970} remarks that "the cluster does not show much concentration but it is detached clearly from the background of a small stellar density which is probably caused by large interstellar absorption". % \citep{Becker1971, Janes1982, Leisawitz1989}. %The precision astrometry of the second data release of {\it Gaia} data \citep{Gaia2016, Gaia2018} has allowed the community to study open clusters in much more detail. 
The object is also listed in the {\it Gaia} DR2 open cluster catalogue of \citet{Cantat2020}, with 95 bona-fide members, an age of 190 Myr, a distance of 3.07 kpc, and a foreground extinction of 2.21 mag.

\section{Gaia EDR3 analysis}
In this work we reanalyse the {\it Gaia} EDR3 data \citep{Gaia2021} down to magnitude $G<19$ in a 30 arcmin circle around the centre of NGC 1605. Our analysis\footnote{reproducible at \url{https://github.com/fjaellet/ngc1605}} uses the three state-of-the-art clustering techniques that have been introduced in the field: The DBSCAN algorithm employed by \citet{Castro2022}, the pyUPMASK code \citep{Pera2021}, and HDBSCAN, the best-performing clustering technique according to \citet{Hunt2021}. 
While the former algorithms yield only one cluster (NGC 1605) in the considered region, HDBSCAN does find another candidate close by - located about 20 arcmin northeast of NGC 1605 and clearly visible as another overdensity in proper-motion space.

We also confirm that the stellar density profile of NGC 1605 is indeed slightly bimodal/irregular. This bimodality, however, is reflected neither in proper motion nor in parallax space, nor in the colour-magnitude diagram. We find no evidence for the tidal streams claimed by \citet{Camargo2021} - their claimed location would also be dynamically inconsistent with the proper motion of the putative sub-clusters.

%After testing several sophisticated membership analyses, we use the automated cluster analysis tool ASteCA \citep{Perren2015, Perren2020} to redetermine the astrophysical parameters based on the available astrometric and photometric data. Memberships are obtained with a Bayesian decontamination algorithm computing the likelihood for being a field or a cluster star based on positions, proper motion, and parallax mesurements. The cluster parameters are then determined with a Bayesian isochrone fit to a family of synthetic PARSEC populations including binaries.
%The results of the ASteCA analysis, including the best-fit cluster parameters, are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:1}. The parameters are consistent with the DR2 analysis of \citet{Cantat2020} (which used a neural network trained on well-studied clusters), but thanks to the better precision of {\it Gaia} EDR3 the number of bona-fide members has doubled and the results are slightly more precise. In addition to distance ($d=2600\pm$ pc, age, and extinction ($E(B_V)=1.06\pm0.07$), ASteCA also delivers a photometric metallicity ([Fe/H]$=-0.1\pm0.2$), an , a lower limit for the present-day cluster mass ($\sim 2000 M_{\odot}$), and a binary fraction (in the mass range probed by {\it Gaia} EDR3; $M \gtrsim 1.1M_{\odot}$) of $61\pm16\%$.

In summary, we find no evidence for NGC 1605 being a genuine binary cluster. The second sequence that \citet{Camargo2021} found in the infra-red colour-magnitude diagram of the region (their Fig. 6) is produced by poorly removed field-star contamination (see Sect. 4 of \citealt{CantatAnders2020} for a discussion).
Nevertheless, NGC 1605 is an intriguing cluster with a peculiar density profile showing clear signs of disintegration as well as differential reddening. Its large Galactocentric distance ($\sim 11$ kpc) also makes it an interesting target for spectroscopic follow-up observations.
