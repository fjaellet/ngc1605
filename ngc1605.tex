\section{Abstract}
The open star cluster NGC 1605 has recently been reported to in fact consist of two clusters (one intermediate-aged and one old) that merged via a flyby capture. Here we show that {\it Gaia} data does not support this scenario. We do, however, find another open-cluster candidate nearby.

\section{Introduction}
Gravitational captures of star clusters by other clusters are very rare and elusive events that can serve as laboratories for the destruction of star clusters (e.g. \citealt{Soubiran2018, Casado2022}). Recently, \citet{Piatti2022} presented a promising candidate for an open cluster collision of the nearby ($d\sim330$ pc) objects IC 4665 and Collinder 350.
Some months earlier, \citet{Camargo2021} reported the existence of a possible binary cluster, dubbed NGC 1605a/b, and suggested that it origined from a flyby capture. The author argued that the long-known cluster NGC 1605 actually consists of two components that have vastly different ages (2 Gyr and 600 Myr). Here we report that {\bf both manual analysis (by each of the authors individually) and} commonly used clustering analysis techniques show no hint for multiple populations in this cluster.

Although relatively distant, close to the Galactic plane, and little studied, NGC 1605 has been included in the Galactic open cluster census since the 1970s. In the first deep photometric analysis, \citet{Fang1970} remarks that "the cluster does not show much concentration but it is detached clearly from the background of a small stellar density which is probably caused by large interstellar absorption". % \citep{Becker1971, Janes1982, Leisawitz1989}. %The precision astrometry of the second data release of {\it Gaia} data \citep{Gaia2016, Gaia2018} has allowed the community to study open clusters in much more detail. 
The object is also listed in the {\it Gaia} DR2 open cluster catalogue of \citet{Cantat2020}, with 95 bona-fide members, an age of 190 Myr, a distance of 3.07 kpc, and a foreground extinction of 2.21 mag.

\section{Gaia EDR3 analysis}
We reanalyse the {\it Gaia} EDR3 data \citep{Gaia2021} down to magnitude $G<19$ in a 30 arcmin circle around the centre of NGC 1605. {\bf After a manual analysis leading to the same results, we carry out a blind} analysis\footnote{reproducible at \url{https://github.com/fjaellet/ngc1605}} using the three state-of-the-art clustering techniques that have been introduced in the field: The DBSCAN algorithm employed by \citet{Castro2022}, the pyUPMASK code \citep{Pera2021}, and HDBSCAN, the preferred method of \citet{Hunt2021}. 
While the former algorithms yield only one cluster in the considered region (NGC 1605), HDBSCAN does find another candidate close by - located about 20 arcmin northwest of NGC 1605 and clearly visible as an overdensity in proper-motion space (see Fig. \ref{fig:1}).

NGC 1605's stellar density on the sky looks slightly irregular at first sight (it seems to be missing stars in its centre). It is, however, at all radii 2$\sigma$-consistent with a typical King profile. There are also no irregularities in proper motion or in parallax space. We find no evidence for the tidal streams claimed by \citet{Camargo2021} - their claimed location would also be dynamically inconsistent with the proper motion of the putative sub-clusters.
The second sequence that \citet{Camargo2021} found in the infra-red colour-magnitude diagram of the region (their Fig. 6) is produced by poorly removed field-star contamination (see Sect. 4 of \citealt{CantatAnders2020} for a discussion).
%After testing several sophisticated membership analyses, we use the automated cluster analysis tool ASteCA \citep{Perren2015, Perren2020} to redetermine the astrophysical parameters based on the available astrometric and photometric data. Memberships are obtained with a Bayesian decontamination algorithm computing the likelihood for being a field or a cluster star based on positions, proper motion, and parallax mesurements. The cluster parameters are then determined with a Bayesian isochrone fit to a family of synthetic PARSEC populations including binaries.
%The results of the ASteCA analysis, including the best-fit cluster parameters, are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:1}. The parameters are consistent with the DR2 analysis of \citet{Cantat2020} (which used a neural network trained on well-studied clusters), but thanks to the better precision of {\it Gaia} EDR3 the number of bona-fide members has doubled and the results are slightly more precise. In addition to distance ($d=2600\pm$ pc, age, and extinction ($E(B_V)=1.06\pm0.07$), ASteCA also delivers a photometric metallicity ([Fe/H]$=-0.1\pm0.2$), an , a lower limit for the present-day cluster mass ($\sim 2000 M_{\odot}$), and a binary fraction (in the mass range probed by {\it Gaia} EDR3; $M \gtrsim 1.1M_{\odot}$) of $61\pm16\%$.

In summary, we find no evidence for NGC 1605 being a genuine binary cluster. Nevertheless, NGC 1605 is an intriguing object: Its large Galactocentric distance ($\sim 11$ kpc) makes it an interesting target for spectroscopic follow-up observations.
